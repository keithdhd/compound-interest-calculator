## Compound Interest Calculator

The magic of compound interest! 

Suppose Lucy invests £100 in a bank account that offers an annual interest rate of 5%. The interest is compounded annually. After 50 years of compound interest at a 5% annual rate, Lucy would have approximately £1,146.74 in her account.

<i>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it earns it. He who doesn’t pays it.”</i>
